# NoteWorthy

## Description
NoteWorthy is a web application that provides a platform for music listeners to log, curate, rate, and review albums that they have listened to. Moreover, listeners are able to connect and share their favourite albums with others on the site. NoteWorthy is also a music encyclopedia, with all the information you need on your favourite albums or albums you have just discovered!

## Key Features
Some key features for NoteWorthy are for users to log the albums they have listened to, log a list of albums for future listening, rate and write reviews for listened albums, and curate collections of albums that they feel have some sort of bearing with each other. All these things will be kept track of for each user and will be displayed on their individual pages. 

Users are able to connect with each other by following each other. In this way, users may discover new people and albums through keeping track of what other users listen to.

Album pages display general information on the album. More importantly, album pages display the average user rating and reviews for said album. 

Key to NoteWorthy is that the albums and album information are crowd-sourced. If NoteWorthy does not have the album a user is looking to log or review, then they will be able to submit a request to add that album onto the application. Each request will be reviewed by our admin team to ensure that the information is reliable and accurate. 

To see whether we here at NoteWorthy have an album or not, users of course can use the search bar on the navigation bar on the top of the page.

## User Instructions
To begin using NoteWorthy, access the site through opening the index.html page. You will be greeted with a login screen. For the login credentials please use: 

__user:__ user

__password:__ user

Once you login you will be greeted with the user page associated with that account--in this case our friend tonybaloney. On the left hand side of this page you will find a user's name, profile picture, biography, and a list of the users they are following. You can see  a full friend list by clicking "See full friend list". Clicking on a user's profile picture in this section brings you to their profile. On user pages that are not your own there is a "follow" or "unfollow" button on the top right of their page. In the central part of the page you will find a user's favourite albums under the "Top Albums" heading. Under that you will find a space with three seperate tabs. Clicking the "Reviews" tab will display the latest reviews that that user has written. Clicking the "Collections" tab shows what list of albums that user has created (by default every user has a "Listened" collection). You can further explore the these collections by clicking their title headings. Finally, the "To Listen" tab displays the albums the user has chosen to queue up on their listening list. Clicking the album art in the "Top Albums", "Reviews", or "To Listen" page will bring you to this section brings you to that album's page. 

Another way for searching for albums is to use the search field in the navigation bar. Currently there are three albums in the database to be searched for: MC Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em", The Beatles' "Help!", and NoteWorthy's in-house album "Bahen...". The search will bring the user a results page. Once on an album page you will find basic information on the album as well as album art and tracklist. Moreover, on the central portion of the page, there are the most recent reviews that users have written. The average rating for the album is displayed on the bottom left of the page. There is also a text box under the recent reviews that allows users to write their own reviews and rate the album. Found under the album art is a "Add to Favourites" button which adds the album to a user's "Top Albums" as well as buttons to add the album to their "Listened" and "To Listen" lists.

If there is an album that a user would like to see added to the database, the "Submit Album" link is located on the top right of the navigation bar. Once on this page, the user will be asked to fill out a form with all the information required for an album to be displayed on NoteWorthy. 

Other than the search bar and the "Submit Album" link, the navigation bar also contains a link back to the profile of the user.
